### About
I am currently a BSUIR student and work as a marketer at Sensys Engineering. I hope to learn a new frontend skill in order to change my field of work. Also, my goal is to make this resume a real resume and not a "just for assignment". 

### Skills
If I went to all the classes at university, I would know:  
• Java  
• C++  
• HTML  
• CSS  
• and many other amazing things!

### Example of code
```
int multiply(int a, int b)
{
   return a * b;
}
```
